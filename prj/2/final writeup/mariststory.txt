I am sorry for being late to subject in school today. My friend was going to
drive me in her vehicle. I was verbing to class, when suddenly I saw a adjective food .
It was so adjective that I had to stop and take a picture, but when I took the picture
suddenly I forgot where I was. It felt like I was at place in the the Future . Luckily,
I saw my friend person and I asked her “What is going on?”. They said “ person , you
better get to class because Professor teacher will be really emotion if you are late”. I
looked down at my watch and it was time , so I knew I had to get to class as soon as
possible. Luckily, my animal was nearby and I rode it to class. 
You are a real food , so I know you will understand. Let me know what work I must make up.
